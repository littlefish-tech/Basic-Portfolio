                            My name is Yimeng Yu, I am working as an office manager at a start up company. I started to interested in becoming a sofeware engineer after I joined the company. I am inspired by how technology is changing the world, disrupting industries and igniting social change. I want to be one of them who can invent the new technology and change the world. The world is changing so fast, and I always feel I am fall behind of the technology.

                            I come from Northeast part of China. That is a very beautiful city and it has four seasons. In spring, you can see everywhere is turning green, after the long winter and you see the spring is finally arrives, the moment may make you feel relax and excite. Then summer comes, it is very hot in summer and raining a lot. When autumn comes, the weather becomes much cooler. Spring and Autumn are my favorite seasons. Winter comes in November, and it becomes very cold in January, and starts to snow.

                            Cooking is my favorite hobby. I like to cook all different kinds of food. I can make Chinese food, Japanese food, Korean food, and I also sometimes make italian food. Cooking is the best way for me to relax. After the busy working weekday, I would like to go grocery and find some idea about the meals for the weekend. Usually on Saturday after, I will start to prepare the dinner, and the whole process of making dinner makes me very satisfied even the dinner only takes aout 30 minutes to finish. I also like to baking, I learned how to make swiss rolls, bread, etc. Even it is not easy to baking, but the whole process is very interesting. Sometimes, people might think it is much more cheaper to buy desserts at stores, but actually the taste you made is totally different from the one you buy in store.
