                            My name is Yimeng Yu, I am working as an office manager at a start up company. I started to interested in becoming a sofeware engineer after I join the company. I can see how great things engineers are creating and I want to be one of them. This is silicon valley, and we are famous by the technology. I know that being a sofeware enginner, I will have a lot more career growth opportunities. I am really excited about this opportunity to be a full-stack coding bootcamp student at UC Berkeley.

                            I come from Northeast part of China. That is a very beautiful city and it snows in winter, but the winter is too cold. I don't really like the winter, it is to code and I just want to stay at home and don't want to go out at all. I love cooking all different kinds of food, but most of them are Chinese food. I love dumplings, pizza, eggs. I like to try all differents food. I can make very good fry rice. Putting a lot of ingredients seems like my habbit. My personal opinion is I need to have all different kind of vegetrables then that can only be enough for a meal. I like traveling, but maybe only once or twice per year.
